Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Hey Marcus, do you have a few minutes? I wanted to walk you through my approach for the consolidated budget model before I get too deep into the build. I'm thinking about structuring it with modular scenario tabs — base case, upside, and a downside stress test — so if leadership wants to pressure-test different margin targets or growth assumptions, we can flex it without rebuilding anything. I also want to make sure I'm pulling the right cost allocation methodology for engineering and hosting — those AWS numbers are going to be the first thing the exec team zeroes in on, and I'd rather have the answer before they ask the question. Can you also tell me who on the accounting side I should be syncing with on actuals? I want to make sure my baseline is airtight before I start layering in assumptions."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley, I appreciate the initiative—this is exactly the kind of forward-thinking work we need. Before you get too far into the build, though, let's make sure we're aligned on a few things. First, I'd like to review your assumptions framework, particularly around the scenario modeling. The board has very specific expectations about how we stress-test margin expansion paths, and I've been working through some of that logic myself. Second, on the cost allocation methodology—you're right that AWS is going to draw scrutiny, but there's also some nuance around how we've historically allocated shared engineering resources that isn't documented anywhere except in my notes from past board presentations. Why don't you block thirty minutes on my calendar tomorrow morning, and we can walk through the structure together before you involve Marcus? That way, when you do present it to him, it'll be bulletproof. And for the accounting sync—talk to Jennifer in Revenue Ops first, but loop me in on that conversation. I want to make sure we're all using the same baseline data."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Karen, thank you for getting in front of this. Riley, your approach looks promising, but I want us to be absolutely consistent on cost allocation and scenario logic before anything goes to Marcus or the board. Karen’s notes from past presentations need to be documented—not just for this exercise, but for future audit and IPO readiness. After your sync tomorrow, please share the draft framework with me and Sarah Martinez. Let’s make sure every assumption and methodology is backed up by baseline data and formal documentation. If you run into any gaps, flag them early—we can’t afford surprises at this stage. And Karen, if you have historical allocation details, let’s pull them together for the team so we’re not relying on institutional memory. This needs to be repeatable and transparent."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Absolutely, David — that makes complete sense, and I'm glad we're aligning on this now rather than three weeks from now. Karen, I'll have a draft assumptions framework pulled together before our sync tomorrow morning so we have something concrete to react to rather than starting from scratch. I want to make sure I'm capturing your historical allocation logic in a format we can formalize and version-control, because you're right that institutional memory isn't a scalable methodology, especially if we're building toward audit and IPO readiness. I'll document everything from our conversation into a shared assumptions log with source citations — that way David and Sarah can review the same artifact, and we're not playing telephone with methodology decisions. On the Jennifer conversation — I'll reach out to her today to get the baseline actuals queue started, and I'll copy you so we're all working from the same numbers. One quick question, David: when you say share the draft framework with Sarah Martinez, is there a specific format or template the board's Audit Committee has been using for methodology documentation? I want to make sure what I build tomorrow isn't just useful for this budget cycle but actually meets the bar Rachel Okonkwo's team would expect to see if this ends up in a diligence room. I'd rather build it right once than rebuild it later."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley, that's a smart question—and exactly the kind of thinking that'll serve us well as we build toward IPO readiness. Rachel hasn't formalized a specific template yet, but I've been in a few conversations with her about documentation standards, particularly around how she expects methodology assumptions to be structured for audit committee review. There are some informal guidelines she's shared with me based on her ServiceTitan experience that would be useful context for what you're building. Why don't we cover that in our sync tomorrow—I can walk you through the format she's responded well to in past presentations, and we can make sure your assumptions log aligns with those expectations from the start. That way, when David and Sarah review it, and if it eventually makes its way to Rachel's team, we're not retrofitting the structure later. I'll also dig up my notes from the last board presentation where we walked through cost allocation—there's some precedent there that'll be helpful. And yes, definitely loop me in on the Jennifer conversation. I want to make sure we're all working from the same actuals baseline before any of this gets too far downstream."
