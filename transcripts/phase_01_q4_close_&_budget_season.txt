Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Alright. First things first." She sat down at her desk, set her coffee beside the keyboard, and opened Marcus Webb's email about the commission irregularities before touching anything else. She read it twice, her jaw tightening on the second pass. Then she murmured to herself, barely audible, "You don't flag something like this and call it 'irregularities' unless you already know it's worse than that." She pulled up the Q4 commission data in the system, opened a fresh spreadsheet, and began cross-referencing the payout files against the approved commission plan. Before she got too deep, she paused, glanced at the calendar invite from her manager, and said quietly, "I need to know the scope of this before that meeting. If this is what I think it is, it changes the whole conversation—about the budget, about the Director role, about everything." She clicked back to the commission data, her grandmother's photograph catching the edge of her vision from the open desk drawer. "Forty dollars and no English," she whispered, and got to work.

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- She stared at the spreadsheet as the numbers began to tell their story, rows of commission payouts that didn't match the approved rate tables, and her stomach tightened in the familiar way it did when a problem stopped being theoretical. "These aren't irregularities," she said to the empty office, her voice flat and certain. "These are systematic overrides. Someone changed the calculation mid-quarter." She highlighted three transactions where the same sales rep received different commission rates on identical deal structures, then pulled up the audit log to see who had access to modify the commission engine. When the log showed multiple finance team members with admin rights—including people who shouldn't have had them—she sat back and exhaled slowly. "David needs to know about this before Monday, but if I tell him now, he'll either shut me down to protect someone or he'll panic and make it worse." She glanced at Marcus's email again, at the careful phrasing that had bypassed her CFO entirely, and understood with sudden clarity that this wasn't a test of her technical skills. "He's asking me because he already suspects David's team is the problem. Which means I'm not investigating irregularities—I'm documenting a control failure that could kill the IPO." She saved the file with timestamp and version control, then opened a new document titled "Commission Reconciliation - Preliminary Findings" because when you're about to tell people their walls have cracks, you'd better have blueprints for the repair.

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Marcus, before the meeting starts, I need you to walk me through the commission reconciliation step by step. If there are overrides or access issues, I want specifics—dates, names, audit log entries. And I want your honest assessment on whether this could be a systemic problem or just isolated mistakes. We can’t afford ambiguity. Pull in Karen Aldridge and Riley Nakamura if you need support, but keep it tight. I’ll handle communication to the board; for now, our priority is understanding the scope and putting immediate controls in place."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Good. David's looping me in, which means I'm not operating in a vacuum anymore—but it also means I need to be careful about what I share and when." She pulled up her preliminary findings document and reviewed it one more time, tightening the language, stripping out any speculation and leaving only what the data showed. Then she stood, straightened her blazer, and walked toward the conference room where Marcus and David were waiting. At the door she paused, centering herself, and when she stepped inside she spoke with the calm precision of someone who had rehearsed nothing but prepared for everything. "I've been cross-referencing the Q4 payout files against the approved commission plan since this morning. What I'm seeing isn't a handful of one-off errors—it's a pattern. There are at least fourteen transactions where commission rates were manually overridden mid-quarter, applied inconsistently across identical deal structures, and the audit log shows admin access permissions that extend well beyond what our controls documentation specifies. I've timestamped and version-controlled everything I've pulled so far, and I have a preliminary framework for remediation that addresses both the immediate reconciliation gap and the access control issue. Before I go further, I want to align on two things: first, what's our disclosure timeline relative to the audit, and second, who else needs to be in this room—because if we're serious about fixing this before it becomes a board-level problem, we need to scope it honestly, not quietly."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley's assessment is accurate, and the control failure she's describing sits within my function—which means I own the remediation plan." She stepped forward slightly, not crowding Riley but making her presence unmistakable, her voice carrying the weight of someone who had spent twenty years translating technical problems into executive language. "The admin access issue is worse than it sounds. We've got at least six people with modify permissions who should only have read access, and the approval workflow that's supposed to flag manual overrides wasn't properly configured when we migrated systems last April. That's a design flaw, not just user error, which means we need to audit every commission calculation since the migration—roughly three quarters of data." She paused, letting the scope land before continuing. "On disclosure timeline: if Rachel Okonkwo asks about Q4 financials before we've reconciled this, we've got a material weakness in internal controls that could trigger restatement conversations. We need to know the dollar impact and have a remediation timeline documented before the next Audit Committee meeting, which is four weeks out. On who else needs to be in the room—we need RevOps to explain why overrides were happening in the first place, and we need Legal to assess whether any of these payouts created contractual obligations we can't unwind. But Marcus, David—before we expand the circle, you need to decide whether this stays operational or becomes a board matter, because once we brief Rachel, the clock starts on formal disclosure requirements and this stops being something we control quietly."
