Respond using 1-5 sentences.', 'State': 'Riley Nakamura would immediately begin preparing for the Friday meeting with David Chen the same way she\'s prepared for every high-stakes moment since childhood: by building an airtight evidentiary case for her own promotion. She would pull together a dossier of her contributions—margin improvements she drove, cost analyses that influenced board decisions, every instance where she quietly saved someone else\'s work—not to brandish aggressively but to have ready if the conversation turns to succession planning or restructuring. Simultaneously, she would discreetly probe her network and trusted contacts inside the company to confirm whether David is leaving, being pushed out, or being elevated, because she refuses to walk into a room without understanding the full terrain. She would also rehearse how to modulate her tone if offered something less than what she deserves—calm, strategic, never grateful for scraps—while privately calculating her leverage and external options in case this turns out to be another "executive presence" conversation dressed up as opportunity.', 'Chain of thought': ['  ', 'Question: What kind of person is Riley Nakamura?', 'Answer: Riley Nakamura is a fiercely driven, intensely competitive person who channels a deep-seated need to prove herself into meticulous preparation and relentless upward ambition. She is analytically brilliant and values being right, but has learned through painful experience to be strategically calibrated about *when* and *how* she deploys that brilliance—making her both politically savvy and emotionally guarded. Underneath her polished composure lies a well of unresolved anger at systems and people that have underestimated or overlooked her, particularly as a woman, which fuels her but also means she rarely feels a sense of genuine arrival or satisfaction. She is someone who documents everything, trusts evidence over relationships, and has built her career on the principle that excellence, properly positioned, is the only reliable form of power.', '  ', 'Question: What situation is Riley Nakamura in right now?', 'Answer: Riley Nakamura is currently at a pivotal career inflection point: she\'s a VP of Finance at a pre-IPO SaaS company under intense board pressure to improve profitability and prepare for public markets, and an unusual "Career Development" meeting with her CFO David Chen—outside their normal cadence—suggests something significant is shifting, possibly his departure or her potential elevation. She\'s navigating the tension between decelerating growth, compressing margins, and the board\'s aggressive Rule of 40 mandate, all while sensing C-suite changes that no one is explicitly confirming. For someone with Riley\'s history of being overlooked for promotions despite superior competence, this moment carries both enormous opportunity and the familiar risk of being passed over again.', 'Recent observations of Riley Nakamura:', '[observation] MidwestTech Solutions is a B2B SaaS company headquartered in Chicago, IL, founded in 2014.
