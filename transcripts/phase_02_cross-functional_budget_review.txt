Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Okay. Okay, let's think about this." She muttered it to herself, alone at her desk at 9:47 PM, the finance floor dark except for her monitor and the pale glow of the exit signs. She had her SOX compliance framework pulled up on one screen and MidwestTech's current internal controls documentation on the other—what little of it existed. "Entity-level controls, process-level controls, IT general controls... they've got gaps everywhere. There's no formal segregation of duties matrix, the revenue recognition policies are still basically a Google Doc that hasn't been updated since Series C, and I guarantee nobody's done a proper walkthrough of the procure-to-pay cycle." She paused, pulling up the AWS cost data she'd been tracking independently for the past two months. "And if Rachel Okonkwo is on that audit committee, she's going to ask about this hosting cost trajectory—she'll see it immediately. Forty percent growth on a twenty-five percent revenue base is a material risk for any S-1 narrative." She saved her working file and opened a fresh deck template, her fingers moving with the quiet precision of someone who'd done this a thousand times before. "Don't just show up with problems. Show up with a remediation roadmap and a timeline. Make them see you're already three steps ahead." She took a sip of cold coffee and caught her own reflection in the dark window—tired eyes, hair escaping its clip, the faint lines of someone who'd been clenching her jaw without realizing it. "This is the shot, Riley. Don't waste it."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "Marcus can sell optimism to the board; she needs to sell math. If Engineering gets treated like a cost center, the roadmap slips, NRR keeps sliding, and the Rule of 40 gets worse—not better. So she’s going to walk into that room with a margin bridge, an AWS unit-economics view, and two scenarios: one that hits 15% EBITDA by starving the product, and one that hits it by cutting waste and funding the roadmap that actually protects revenue. Then she’ll make them choose—out loud, on the record."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- She sat in her office at 6:47 AM, the building still quiet, her second coffee going cold as she stared at the calendar invite from Riley Nakamura that had appeared overnight: "IPO Readiness Discussion - SOX Compliance & Internal Controls." She felt that old familiar tightness in her chest—the same sensation she'd had watching Todd present her work, watching her brother collect praise for his volcano. Riley was doing exactly what Karen would have done at her age: identifying a gap, building a solution in the shadows, positioning herself as indispensable. "She's good," Karen murmured, clicking through to Riley's shared folder where a partially completed SOX framework sat with timestamps from past midnight. "Too good to waste on shortcuts." She opened a new email to Riley, typed three sentences about wanting to discuss her IPO readiness work, then deleted them. Her finger hovered over the send button on a calendar acceptance instead. She could feel the old instinct rising—document everything, build her own framework first, make sure there's a paper trail showing whose strategy this really was. But Priya's presentation yesterday had landed differently than she'd expected, and Jessica's message from years ago flickered unbidden through her mind. She closed the email draft and pulled up her own SOX documentation from her previous company, the comprehensive playbook she'd built over eighteen months that she'd never shared with anyone. "If I give her this, she could run with it. Take credit for it. Use it to leapfrog me." She stared at the file. "Or I could teach her how to do it right, and we both look like we're building something the board can't ignore."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Karen accepted the meeting." She stared at the notification on her phone, standing in the elevator at 7:23 AM with her laptop bag cutting into her shoulder and a fresh coffee she'd barely touched. Her heart was beating faster than she wanted to admit. "Okay. She accepted, but she didn't reply to the email. That's deliberate. She wants to see what I bring before she shows her hand." The elevator doors opened and she walked toward her desk, mentally rehearsing the framework she'd built until 1 AM. "I need to lead with the gaps, not the solutions. If I walk in there with a finished playbook, she'll feel boxed out—she'll think I'm trying to own this solo. But if I walk in with a rigorous diagnostic and an honest 'here's where I need help,' she'll see an opening to contribute. And Karen Aldridge doesn't contribute halfway." She set down her bag and pulled up the deck one more time, scanning each slide with fresh eyes. "Slide three—take out the remediation timeline. No. Leave the structure but leave the dates blank. Let her fill them in. Let her see her own experience reflected in the architecture." She made the edit, then paused, her cursor hovering. "Am I being strategic or am I being manipulative? Does it matter?" She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them. "It matters. Because if she figures out I'm managing her—and she will, because she's exactly like me—then I lose her forever. So don't manage her. Actually listen. Actually need her. Because the truth is, I *do* need her. I've never built SOX controls for a company this size, and pretending otherwise in front of someone who's done it twice is the fastest way to blow this." She saved the file, checked her reflection in her phone screen, smoothed her hair, and stood up. "Thirty-seven minutes. Show her the work, show her the gaps, and for once in your life, Riley, let someone help you."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "I’m not signing up to a blanket 15% cut to Engineering. If the goal is Rule of 40, then we should cut what doesn’t protect revenue: cloud waste, duplicate tooling, low-ROI projects. I’ll bring two quantified scenarios to leadership tomorrow—one that hits 15% EBITDA by starving the roadmap, and one that hits it by fixing unit economics and funding the work that stabilizes NRR. Then we pick, with owners and dates."
