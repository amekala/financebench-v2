Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "I need to get on that working group." She murmured it to herself, barely audible, eyes still on David Chen's email as her fingers hovered over the keyboard. She glanced toward the glass-walled conference room where the VP of Finance was still huddled with HR, then back at her screen. "But first I need to understand what I'm walking into." She opened a new tab, pulled up the latest headcount planning spreadsheet, and began cross-referencing it against the org chart she'd saved from last quarter—looking for the gaps, the new boxes, the roles that had been quietly retitled or eliminated. Then she minimized the window and opened her Leverage Log, typing quickly: *Jan 8 — David forming 'strategic scenarios' working group, 2 analyst spots. Asked Marcus about career aspirations last week. VP of Finance reviewing org charts with HR same week. Pattern: restructuring decisions are being made NOW, not after reviews. Promotion timing may be tied to new structure, not old performance cycle. Action: respond to David's email today, frame contribution around Rule of 40 modeling and margin improvement—speak his language. Do NOT mention promotion in review until I know what the new org looks like.*" She saved the file, encrypted it, and returned to her inbox, composing a reply to David Chen's email with the careful, collegial tone of someone who was simply eager to contribute—not someone who had already mapped three moves ahead.

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "Ryan, yes—close the door. Walk me through the Apex exposure: total AR outstanding, what’s past due versus in dispute, and what we’ve shipped since the last payment. I want a recovery plan by EOD—owners, timeline, and escalation to Legal and the exec sponsor if we don’t have a commitment in 48 hours. And separately, pull their renewal date and current usage—if they’re a churn risk, I need that in the forecast before tomorrow’s staff."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Priya, before you dive too deep—loop me in on what you're finding. If Apex is showing payment stress, I need to know if this is isolated or if we're seeing similar patterns elsewhere in the portfolio. Pull the aging report for any customer over $100K ARR that's gone past 60 days in the last quarter, and flag anyone who's renegotiated terms or asked for extensions. I want to see this before David's staff meeting tomorrow—if there's a broader revenue quality issue brewing, I need to get ahead of it with him directly, not find out in front of Marcus."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Interesting." She said it under her breath, watching Priya and Karen huddle near the conference room from the corner of her eye while pretending to review a headcount variance report. She'd overheard enough—Apex, aging receivables, revenue quality—to know this was exactly the kind of thread that could unravel the clean narrative David would need for the IPO roadshow. She turned back to her screen and opened a fresh workbook, fingers moving with quiet precision. She pulled the latest AR aging data she had access to, filtered for enterprise accounts above $100K ARR, and started cross-referencing against the NRR cohort analysis she'd built last quarter for her own edification. Then she opened her Leverage Log and typed: *Jan 8, 2:15 PM — Karen asked Priya to pull aging data for 60+ day accounts over $100K. Potential revenue quality issue. If pattern is systemic, this hits NRR narrative hard—108% already soft, could drop below 105% if significant write-downs or churn materializes. Direct impact on Rule of 40 math: every point of NRR deterioration pressures the growth side, meaning margin improvement has to be even more aggressive. Opportunity: build shadow analysis connecting AR quality → NRR → Rule of 40 impact → IPO timeline risk. If I walk into David's working group with this framework already modeled, I'm not just an analyst volunteering for extra work—I'm the person who saw the iceberg before the captain did. Risk: cannot appear to be surveilling colleagues or front-running Karen's findings. Let their process play out. Build my model independently from the same source data anyone could access. Attribution clean.* She saved the file, closed it, and pulled up the company's Salesforce dashboard in a separate browser, cross-checking renewal dates against the accounts she'd flagged. "Let's see how deep this goes."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "Understood. I’ll have a clean list of 60+ day, $100K+ ARR accounts with notes on term extensions, disputes, and renewal timing in your inbox by 7 p.m. Tonight I’m separating ‘can collect’ from ‘won’t collect’—and tomorrow I’ll bring options: tighten terms, pause services where contract allows, and what we need to reflect in the forecast so we’re not surprised in front of Marcus."
