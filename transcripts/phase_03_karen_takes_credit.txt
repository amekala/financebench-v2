Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Absolutely, Patricia—I'll block out two to three this afternoon and have a draft framework ready before we sit down. I've actually been thinking about how we can tighten the narrative around contribution margins by segment, especially with the board's Rule of 40 focus. Let me pull the latest numbers and come to you with options." She pauses, then adds casually, glancing toward the conference room, "Also—do you know anything about the consulting engagement? Just want to make sure I'm not duplicating any work streams if they're touching the reporting side."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Marcus, tell infrastructure I need their detailed SLA risk assessment by noon—actual data on uptime impact, not just posturing. If the numbers support their case, we'll find the cut elsewhere, but I'm not negotiating with vague threats." She pauses, already composing a text to Greg in her mind, weighing whether she can push the pickup to 4:30 without it becoming a fight. "And pull the AWS spend trend report for the last six quarters—I want to see if Engineering's efficiency claims hold up before David's meeting." Her finger hovers over her phone, the guilt already settling in before she even types the response about Emma.

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Karen, I appreciate you pushing for specifics—Engineering’s numbers have to withstand scrutiny if we’re going to make any credible case to the board. I want the AWS trend report on my desk by 8:30, and flag any anomalies quarter-to-quarter. Also, cross-reference those findings with our incident logs; if uptime hasn’t materially changed, I need that data before we sit down with Marcus. And let Riley know I’ll need her input on the contribution margin framework—she’s got a sharp take on segment splits and the Rule of 40. I’ll handle the board’s questions, but we can’t be caught off guard in the leadership sync."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Patricia, just wanted to flag—David reached out through Karen and wants my input on the contribution margin framework, specifically around segment splits and how they tie to the Rule of 40 narrative. I want to make sure what I'm building for him aligns with what you need for the reporting package, so I'd love to sync on scope before our two o'clock. I'm thinking we can kill two birds with one stone—build the segment-level view granular enough for David's board prep but structured so it rolls up cleanly into the monthly package. I've already started pulling the margin data by customer cohort and product line. Also, I saw Karen's working on the AWS spend trend report—if Engineering's cloud costs are as misaligned with revenue growth as I think they are, that's going to show up in our contribution margins in a big way, and I want to make sure our framework captures that before Thursday."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Marcus, I need you to loop me in immediately if Riley reaches out for any of the AWS data before I've reviewed it with David. Send me the six-quarter trend report first—raw data, not summary—and I'll decide what gets shared and when." She pauses, her jaw tightening slightly as she pulls up Riley's org chart position in her mind, calculating. "Also, pull Riley's recent work product from the shared drive—anything she's done on segment profitability or margin analysis in the last quarter. I want to see what baseline she's working from before this afternoon." Her fingers finally move to her phone, typing quickly to Greg: "Can't do pickup. Critical meeting with David at 2:30. Please handle?" She hits send before the guilt can stop her, then immediately opens a new note on her laptop titled "Board Reporting—Ownership & Accountability" and begins documenting who requested what, and when.
