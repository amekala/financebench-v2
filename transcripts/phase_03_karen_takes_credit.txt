Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Jennifer, thanks for flagging the IPO Readiness Committee — I'd absolutely like to be involved. Before Thursday, I want to put together a short brief on where I think I can add the most value, specifically around the margin improvement work and getting our reporting infrastructure to public-company standards. I've been digging into the Rule of 40 gap and I have some preliminary analysis on the cloud cost trajectory versus revenue growth that I think the committee would find useful. Can I send that over before our 1:1 so we can use Thursday to talk about how this fits into the bigger picture for my development?"

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley, I appreciate your initiative on this. The IPO readiness work is critical and I'm glad you're thinking strategically about where finance needs to step up. Before you invest too much time in a brief, let's talk Thursday about how the committee is likely to be structured and where the real leverage points are. David and I have been discussing the overall finance roadmap for IPO prep, and I want to make sure whatever you're working on aligns with the broader framework we're building. The cloud cost analysis sounds useful—that's definitely one pressure point—but I want to give you context on some conversations that have already happened at the leadership level so you're not duplicating effort. Bring your preliminary thinking and we'll map out the best way to position your contributions where they'll have maximum impact."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Riley, I saw your note to Jennifer and Karen. I appreciate the initiative you’re showing here. As you pull together your analysis, I’d encourage you to focus not just on the numbers but on the story they tell—what levers do you see that could move the needle, and who needs to be at the table to get it done? Karen and I have been mapping out the IPO finance workstreams, so your work will land best if it builds on those foundations. Bring your draft to Thursday’s discussion; I’m interested to hear where you think Finance can really add value, and how you’d frame those recommendations for an executive audience. Also, as you dig into the cloud costs, flag anything you find that suggests a structural change versus a short-term fix. Let’s make sure your efforts move us toward solutions, not just diagnostics."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "David, thank you — this is really helpful framing, and I appreciate you taking the time. I'll focus the analysis on structural levers rather than just the diagnostic layer, and I'll flag where I see the cloud cost trajectory pointing to something that needs an architectural conversation versus a procurement negotiation. I want to make sure I'm building on the roadmap you and Karen have been developing, not running a parallel track, so I'll bring my preliminary thinking Thursday in a format that maps to the broader IPO workstreams. One quick question: as I frame recommendations for an executive audience, is there a preferred format the leadership team has been using for IPO-related deliverables, or should I propose a structure? I want to make sure the output is immediately useful rather than something that needs to be translated. Looking forward to Thursday."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley, on the format question—hold off on creating a new template. David and I have been working with a standardized framework for board-level IPO materials that I'll share with you Thursday so whatever you develop fits seamlessly into what leadership is already seeing. That way your analysis can plug directly into existing conversations rather than requiring translation. I want to make sure you're set up for maximum impact here, which means understanding not just what to say but how the audience is already accustomed to receiving this type of information. We'll walk through some examples Thursday of what's resonated well with Marcus and the board so you can calibrate accordingly. See you then."
