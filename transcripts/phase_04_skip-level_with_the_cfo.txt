Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Okay. First things first." She closed the mentor's text without replying, set her phone face-down on the desk, and opened the Q4 actuals in a new tab. She murmured to herself as the numbers loaded, already scanning for the story beneath the miss. "Eight percent revenue shortfall, twelve percent OpEx overage... that's not a one-quarter problem, that's a structural problem somebody's been papering over." She pulled up her notebook—the current one, a leather-bound Leuchtturm she'd been using since September—and wrote the date at the top of a fresh page, then added three bullet points: *retention conversations with Priya and James before end of week, build variance bridge before David one-on-one, map who benefits from the restructuring narrative.* She glanced through the glass wall toward the executive wing where David and the CEO had disappeared, then back at her screen. "Show me where they buried it."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Walk me through the variance bridge, Riley. I want details—not just line items, but what’s driving the underlying behavior. Let’s identify which cost centers are recurring issues and where the assumptions broke down. And flag any areas where you think leadership narratives diverge from the actual numbers."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Absolutely. Let me walk you through it." She opened the variance bridge she'd built the night before, a tightly structured spreadsheet with color-coded flags, and turned her laptop so David could follow along. "Starting at the top—revenue missed by $6.2 million against plan. About sixty percent of that is timing-related: three enterprise deals that were forecasted to close in Q4 slipped into Q1. Sales leadership flagged two of them as 'high confidence' in the October pipeline review, but when I pulled the underlying stage progression data, neither deal had moved past legal redline by November. So the forecast confidence was narrative, not evidence-based. That's a recurring issue—we've had optimistic pipeline staging in three of the last four quarters, and nobody's recalibrating the conversion assumptions." She flipped to the next tab. "The other forty percent is more structural and, frankly, more concerning. Net revenue retention dropped to 108%, and mid-market logo churn hit nine percent. Expansion revenue from existing accounts underperformed by $2.4 million. Customer Success is running at about sixty percent of the headcount they'd need to properly manage the install base, and the upsell motion is basically unfunded. So we're spending aggressively on new logo acquisition while letting the back of the house bleed." She paused, then moved to the cost side. "On OpEx—twelve percent over budget, but it's not evenly distributed. Engineering is the story. They're at 55% of total operating expenses, and AWS hosting alone grew 40% year-over-year against our 25% revenue growth. When I dug into the cost allocation, there are at least three infrastructure projects that were approved as 'temporary scaling measures' in 2024 that are now permanent line items nobody's revisiting. The engineering leadership narrative is 'investing in platform resilience,' but the unit economics say we're subsidizing architectural decisions that aren't translating to product velocity or customer outcomes." She looked up from the screen. "David, the assumptions didn't just break down—some of them were never sound. The Q4 plan was built on conversion rates we hadn't hit since 2024, retention numbers that assumed a Customer Success investment we never made, and engineering cost projections that treated variable cloud spend as fixed. If we rebuild the 2026 plan on the same foundation, we'll be sitting here in twelve months having the same conversation, except the board won't be asking for a bridge—they'll be asking for heads."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "That’s clear, Riley. I appreciate the precision. Let’s break this down into action items. First, I want a documented recalibration proposal for pipeline staging—something Sales can’t hand-wave past. Second, pull the actuals for those infrastructure projects and flag any spend that’s become baseline without justification; I want Engineering in the room next week to defend every dollar. Third, draft a headcount and investment model for Customer Success that ties resource allocation directly to retention and upsell outcomes. We’ll present it to Marcus and the board as part of the Q1 remediation plan. And Riley—note which narratives you think are most misaligned with the data. I want to see them side by side before we go into the budget review."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "I'll have all three ready. Pipeline recalibration proposal by Wednesday—I'll anchor it to actual stage-to-close conversion rates from the last six quarters so there's no room for anecdotal overrides. On the engineering spend, I'll pull the original approval memos for those infrastructure projects and compare the stated scope and timeline against current run-rate; if something was approved as a six-month scaling measure and it's still on the books eighteen months later, that's the flag. And for the Customer Success model, I want to tie headcount directly to book-of-business ratios and show the retention delta between accounts that have dedicated CSM coverage versus the ones that don't—I think the data will make the investment case self-evident." She paused, then added more carefully, "On the narrative comparison—I'll build it, but I want to be thoughtful about framing. If we walk into the budget review with a document that reads like an indictment of Sales and Engineering leadership, we'll get defensiveness instead of alignment, and the board will see a company that's fighting internally instead of executing. I'd recommend we frame it as 'planning assumptions versus observed outcomes' rather than 'what leadership got wrong.' The data speaks for itself—we don't need to make it personal to make it undeniable. The people in that room will know exactly what it means." She made a note in her Leuchtturm, then looked back up at David. "One more thing—I want to flag the team retention issue. I've heard that Priya and James have both been approached by recruiters. They're two of my strongest analysts, and they're going to be essential to executing all of this in the next six weeks. I'd like to have proactive conversations with both of them this week. Do I have room to discuss any retention levers, or should I keep it informal for now?"
