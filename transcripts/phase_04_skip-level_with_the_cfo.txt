Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Hey David, got a sec? I wanted to flag something before budget season hits — my team wrapped Q4 close two days early, so I've got a little bandwidth to dig into the cloud cost trajectory before the department heads start circling their wagons. But honestly... you doing okay? You seemed a bit off after the all-hands."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Thanks for checking in, Riley. I appreciate it. It’s been a long week, but I’m alright. And congrats on wrapping close early—that’s no small feat. If you’ve got bandwidth, I’d welcome your perspective on AWS spend; Engineering and Finance need to get on the same page before budget reviews start. Let’s set up some time to look at the numbers together. And if you spot anything we should flag to Marcus ahead of the department meeting, let me know."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Absolutely, I'll get that on the calendar for later this week. I'm thinking I'll pull the AWS billing data alongside our revenue cohort growth and engineering deployment logs — if we can show cost-per-customer trends and map where the inefficiencies are clustering, we'll have something concrete to bring to Marcus instead of just a scary top-line number. I want to make sure we're walking into that department meeting with a narrative, not just a spreadsheet. I'll have a preliminary cut ready before we sit down — that way you can poke holes in my assumptions before anyone else sees it. And David... seriously, if things get heavier than 'a long week,' you know where to find me."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Thanks, Riley. That approach makes sense — the more we can link usage to real customer value, the stronger our case with Engineering and the board. I’ll keep an eye out for your draft and carve out time for feedback. And I appreciate the offer — sometimes I forget it’s okay to lean on the team. Let’s stay focused on the numbers for now, but I hear you."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Sounds good, David. I'll have something for you by Thursday morning at the latest. And one more thing — I noticed Raj and Sandra going at it pretty hard in the fishbowl after the all-hands. I don't know the details, but if there's a Sales-CS rift brewing over churn numbers or headcount, that's going to land in our lap during budget reviews whether we want it to or not. Might be worth us having a read on what's happening there before we walk into the room. I can grab coffee with Sandra this week — she and I have a decent rapport from the renewal forecasting work last quarter. No agenda, just listening. That way if it does blow up in the budget meeting, we're not caught flat-footed and we can position Finance as the honest broker instead of the department that just says no."
