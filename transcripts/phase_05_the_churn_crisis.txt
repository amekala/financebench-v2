Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "'t be filled by winning. I close the laptop. Fifteen weeks. I know exactly what I need to do—I just need to make sure no one sees me building the staircase until I'm already standing at the top."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Come in, Derek. Close the door behind you." She sets down her coffee and turns from the monitor, her expression neutral but attentive. "Show me what you found. And walk me through your methodology—I need to understand if this is a data issue or something more fundamental before David's meeting this afternoon."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Derek, start from the beginning. What prompted your review, and which datasets did you pull? If you see inconsistencies, walk me through the numbers line by line—let’s make sure we’re not missing anything before we brief the board."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "Jennifer, come in—shut the door. Tell me the headline first: what moved, by how much, and versus which plan. Then walk me through your methodology and the data sources so I can separate a real variance from a reporting artifact. If it’s real, I want the ‘so what’ in two sentences and the decision we need from David before his meeting this afternoon."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "He wants product-line margin by end of week because the board’s about to ask what we’re doing about Rule of 40—and they’re not going to accept blended answers. Pull David into a quick alignment today: what story are we telling, and what decisions do we want teed up—pricing, cloud efficiency, headcount, or segment focus. Then keep this tight: Sarah and one analyst, no broad distro, and I want a bridge that ties cleanly to the GL with assumptions we can defend under Audit Committee scrutiny."

Step 7 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Janet, do you have five minutes? I've been building out the cross-departmental cost analysis and I want to make sure my framing aligns with what David needs before his board prep. I'm structuring it around the Rule of 40 path—mapping each cost center's contribution to the margin gap and flagging the three or four levers that actually move the needle. I also want to flag something: Engineering's AWS spend is growing at 40% against 25% revenue growth, and when I layer in the headcount requests coming through, the OpEx picture gets worse before it gets better. I'd rather surface that now with a recommendation than let it come up cold in a board meeting. Can I walk you through where I am and get your read on how aggressive we should be with the conclusions?"

Step 8 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Derek, before you show me anything, I need you to tell me who else you've talked to about this. Have you mentioned these anomalies to anyone—David, Priya, anyone in accounting?" She keeps her voice level, but her fingers have stilled on the keyboard. "And when you say 'enterprise segment numbers,' are we talking about revenue recognition, margin calculations, or something in the underlying data feeds? I need to know the scope before we decide how to handle this."
