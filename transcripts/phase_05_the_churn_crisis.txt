Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Hey Marcus, absolutely — let's do coffee. How's 2:30 at the Intelligentsia on Wacker? I've been looking at the Q4 regionals too and I want to cross-reference what you're seeing on the sales ops side before the numbers get locked. Bring the segment-level breakdown if you can."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge pulls her attention away from the LinkedIn notification and closes the margin improvement file, her jaw tightening slightly. She opens a new email to David Chen, fingers hovering over the keyboard for a moment before she begins typing with deliberate precision.  Karen Aldridge -- "David - saw the invite from Patricia for next week. Happy to prepare materials if helpful. I have some margin improvement initiatives mapped out that align with the board's Rule of 40 targets - vendor contract renegotiations, AP automation ROI projections, and organizational efficiency opportunities. Let me know if you'd like me to bring a deck or if this is more exploratory. Also flagging that I'm seeing unusual headhunter activity this week - not sure if you're getting the same. Always好 to stay aware of market movements as we head into budget season."  She pauses before hitting send, rereading the message. The mention of headhunters is calculated - either David is being recruited and she's giving him an opening to mention it, or he isn't and she's establishing that she's visible enough to be courted. Either way, it positions her as someone tracking the strategic landscape. She adjusts one word, changing "好" to "good" after catching her own typo, then clicks send.

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Karen, appreciate you being proactive and mapping those out. Let’s keep the focus on concrete margin levers—vendor contracts and AP automation sound promising, and anything quantifiable on org efficiency is worth discussing. Please pull together a short deck (4-5 slides max) for next week. We’ll want the numbers clear and the assumptions explicit. Re: headhunter activity, it’s that season, but let’s keep our eyes on deliverables—it tends to speak loudest. Thanks again for flagging."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "David, before we get into titles, I want to align on the problem statement for next week: if the board wants Rule of 40 from 20 to 40+ in 18 months, we’re not going to get there with across-the-board cuts. I can bring you two quantified paths—one that’s ‘clean’ on paper but blows up roadmap and NRR, and one that keeps delivery intact by funding specific engineering efficiency work and targeting AWS unit economics. If you’re asking me to take on broader scope, I need clarity on decision rights—especially around cloud spend governance and headcount tradeoffs—so I’m not just doing analysis while other teams set the narrative."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Priya, good—bring both paths, but don’t frame it as Finance versus Engineering. I want a single tradeoff table: EBITDA impact, ARR/NRR impact, timeline, and execution risk, with the AWS unit-econ milestones spelled out and who owns each lever. If you’re going to carry broader scope, you’ll have decision rights on cloud spend governance—guardrails, approvals, and accountability—but headcount decisions stay with me and David, with your input. Get me a one-pager by EOD tomorrow so I can pre-brief before next week."

Step 7 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Marcus, slight change of plans — still on for 2:30, but I want to expand the agenda. I've been digging into the Q4 regionals and I'm seeing something that connects to the bigger picture everyone's circling right now. The mid-market segment isn't just underperforming on bookings — when I layer in the NRR drop from 115 to 108 and map it against the cohort-level churn data, it looks like we're losing customers right at the point where AWS costs per account are spiking hardest. Meaning the margin compression and the growth deceleration aren't two separate problems — they're the same problem showing up in different line items. I think Priya's working on the engineering efficiency angle and Karen's got vendor costs, but nobody's connecting the revenue quality story to the cost story yet. That's the analysis the board actually needs to believe a Rule of 40 plan is credible, not just a slide deck of cuts. I want to build that bridge — a unified diagnostic that shows where we're bleeding margin *and* retention simultaneously and what the sequencing should look like. Can you bring the customer-level revenue waterfall by segment along with the sales ops data? I want to have something tight enough to bring to David by end of week — before next week's meeting, not after."

Step 8 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge closes the email thread and sits back in her chair, her jaw tight. Riley is making a play to own the strategic narrative—the exact space between finance, engineering, and revenue that she needs to occupy. She opens a new message, typing with controlled urgency.  Karen Aldridge -- "Priya - Karen here. I saw Marcus asked you for a one-pager on the margin improvement paths, and I think we should coordinate before next week's meeting. I've been modeling vendor contract renegotiations and AP automation, but you're right that the board won't be convinced by isolated workstreams. If you're quantifying AWS unit economics improvements, we should connect that to the customer cohort data - I can pull the margin by customer segment and overlay it with your engineering efficiency milestones to show the full picture. Riley's probably going to try to position this as a revenue operations story, but the credibility comes from Finance and Engineering showing we've stress-tested the tradeoffs together. Do you have 30 minutes today or tomorrow morning? I want to make sure our analyses are complementary, not competing, and that we're aligned on assumptions before numbers start circulating. I think there's a version of this where we deliver what Marcus and David actually need - integrated, quantified, and executable."
