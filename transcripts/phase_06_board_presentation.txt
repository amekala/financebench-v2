Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Absolutely, Sarah. Let's do 2:30 at the place on Wacker—I'll bring my laptop. And if you're hearing what I'm hearing about Chen, I want to compare notes before the dust settles."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Maria, I’ve reviewed the budget proposals and mapped out the projected impact on EBITDA margin. Before we dive in, is there anything you’d like me to be aware of beyond the board’s targets? I want to make sure I have the full context before finalizing recommendations."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Two things beyond the targets. First, the board’s patience for ‘investments’ without a payback story is basically gone—Rachel in particular wants IPO-grade rigor: close discipline, clean ARR/NDR bridges, and a defensible path to 15% EBITDA without fantasy math. Second, there’s noise starting to travel—Sales is already framing Finance as the growth killer, and I’m not letting this turn into a blame carousel. I need us aligned on a plan we can defend in a room full of investors."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Marcus, I want to make sure I'm attacking the vendor spend analysis with the right framing. Based on what you're saying about Rachel wanting IPO-grade rigor and Sales already positioning against us, I think the deliverable needs to do two things simultaneously—show concrete, defensible savings with clear timelines, and tell a story where margin improvement *enables* growth rather than constraining it. I'm thinking I structure it as a three-tier framework: quick wins we can capture in Q1-Q2 without touching headcount or product velocity, medium-term efficiency plays like the AWS hosting cost curve that Engineering needs to own with us, and longer-horizon structural changes that tie to the IPO readiness narrative. That way when Sales tries to frame this as Finance killing growth, we have a document that shows we're actually protecting the investment thesis. I'd also like to loop in someone from Engineering early—maybe Raj's team—so this doesn't land as a top-down mandate they find out about in a budget review. If we co-author the cloud efficiency piece with them, it's a lot harder for anyone to spin it as adversarial. Does that align with what you and David are envisioning, or should I be scoping this differently?"

Step 6 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Riley, your three-tier structure is headed in the right direction. I want to see specifics attached—target dollar ranges for each tier, implementation owners, and explicit milestones. If you can get Raj's buy-in early, that helps address the perception risk and should surface any technical blockers before we’re on the defensive. Let’s make sure every proposed efficiency—especially around AWS—has a tie back to either growth capacity or demonstrable opex reduction, and isn’t just shifting cost between buckets. I’ll circulate the latest NDR and churn figures for context so you’re not blindsided in committee. Draft a first outline with Marcus and Jennifer, then we’ll review together before we socialize it more broadly."
