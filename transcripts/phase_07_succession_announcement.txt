Respond using 1-5 sentences.', 'State': "Riley Nakamura would immediately triage the Q4 revenue recognition discrepancy with Priya, documenting it meticulously and building a clear remediation narrative before deciding whom to escalate it to—instinctively wanting to protect David but recognizing that bringing it directly to the Audit Committee or Marcus's attention could position her as the person who prioritizes the company's IPO-readiness over internal loyalty. She would prepare obsessively for the Marcus Webb meeting, constructing multiple scenario models for what it might mean—David's departure, a restructuring, a test of her leadership capacity—so that no possible question catches her off guard. She would study David's behavioral shifts like anomalous data points, quietly corroborating her instincts by tracking his calendar, his demeanor, and his communication patterns without ever directly asking him what's wrong, because direct emotional inquiry feels more dangerous than inference. She would resist the urge to confide in anyone about what she suspects is happening, because sharing uncertainty feels like admitting she doesn't have control of the situation. And underneath all of this strategic positioning, she would push down the low hum of anxiety that whispers she's about to be the fourteen-year-old excluded from the sleepover again—that no matter how indispensable she makes herself, someone could still choose someone else.", 'Chain of thought': ['  ', 'Question: What kind of person is Riley Nakamura?', "Answer: Riley Nakamura is a hyper-competent, intensely self-monitoring professional who converts emotional pain into performance and treats every setback as a data problem to be optimized rather than a wound to be felt. She learned early that love and approval were conditional on flawlessness, and she built her identity around being indispensable—the person no one can afford to overlook, even if they never quite embrace her. She is deeply perceptive, cataloging social dynamics and power structures with the same rigor she applies to financial models, but this analytical lens also keeps genuine intimacy at arm's length. Underneath her disciplined exterior is someone still haunted by a 96 on a math test—someone who equates vulnerability with failure and rest with risk, and who measures her own worth in the same unsentimental terms she'd apply to a company's EBITDA margin.", '  ', 'Question: What situation is Riley Nakamura in right now?', "Answer: Riley Nakamura is currently at a critical inflection point where several professional dynamics are converging simultaneously: the board's aggressive push toward IPO-readiness plays directly to her strengths in financial rigor and modeling, while unusual signals—Marcus Webb's direct outreach, David Chen's distracted behavior and broken routines—suggest a potential leadership shakeup in Finance that could either elevate her or destabilize her position. On top of this, Priya's discovery of the Q4 revenue recognition discrepancy puts a ticking compliance issue in her hands that she'll need to navigate carefully, since how she handles it will signal whether she's a Senior Finance Manager protecting her CFO or a future finance leader protecting the company. For someone who has spent her entire life making herself indispensable to avoid vulnerability, this is exactly the kind of high-stakes, multi-variable situation she's been unconsciously preparing for—but it will also test whether her instinct to control every outcome serves her or limits her.", 'Recent observations of Riley N
