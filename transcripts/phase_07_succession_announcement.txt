Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Priya, can you pull together a breakdown of the last three quarters of non-revenue function spend by department? I want actuals, not budget—and layer in headcount growth rates alongside. I need it by Wednesday at the latest. And while you're at it, flag any line items where we're seeing cost growth outpacing the department's contribution metrics. I want this analysis to be airtight before I put anything in front of Marcus." She paused, then added with studied casualness, "Oh, and do you remember which consultants were on that calendar invite Marcus got? I want to make sure we're not duplicating any work they're already scoping."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Priya, hold on a second." She stands from her desk and walks to her office door, closing it quietly before returning to where her analyst sits. "That analysis Riley's asking for—I need you to run the same breakdown for me first, but I want it by end of day today, not Wednesday. Same parameters, but add one more layer: map any external consulting engagements or advisory fees against those departmental spend patterns, especially anything initiated in the last six months." She pauses, her voice dropping slightly. "And I want you to keep two separate files. One clean summary for general distribution, and one working file with your full methodology and source data that stays between us. Don't email either version until I review them personally."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Karen, can I grab you for a minute? I want to clarify something on this latest spend analysis request. I understand you want a fast turnaround and some tight control on the files, but let’s make sure we’re not duplicating work or fragmenting data. If Priya is pulling numbers for Riley and for you in parallel, I expect both versions to reconcile cleanly and be auditable end-to-end—no shadow files, no ambiguity on methodology. If you’ve got concerns about consultant fees, let’s surface them openly in the next FP&A sync so we’re aligned before anything goes to Marcus or the board. That kind of transparency matters right now, especially given where we are in the margin conversations. And Karen—anything you need to keep close, I’ll review with you personally before wider distribution. But let’s remember: we’re one finance team, not silos. Fair?"

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Priya’s going to do one pull, one dataset, one methodology. Riley and Karen can get whatever cuts they want off the same source of truth, but there will not be two versions of ‘reality’ floating around my org. David—lock down ownership and an audit trail today, and I want the reconciled deck on my desk tomorrow morning with the top five spend drivers, the EBITDA impact, and the decision we’re making on each. Karen, if there’s a consultant-fee concern, bring it into the open with numbers and a recommendation—no side files. Riley, same standard: airtight, attributable, and tied to levers. We’re too close to IPO prep for politics."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Understood, Marcus. I'll work off Priya's single pull and have my cuts tied directly to the five spend drivers you want in the deck—each one mapped to an actionable lever with the EBITDA impact quantified. I'll have my section to David by end of day so he can reconcile everything before your morning deadline." She paused, then added with the precise calibration of someone who had rehearsed the moment in her head before it arrived. "One thing I'd like to flag: as I've been building out the cost-reduction scenarios, I've been layering in some sensitivity analysis around how different cut levels affect our NRR trajectory and customer retention staffing. I think that context is going to matter when this goes to the board—if it's helpful, I'm happy to include that as an appendix to the deck. And Marcus, if there's a point where the IPO Readiness Task Force needs finance modeling support on the margin-improvement narrative, I'd welcome the chance to contribute there as well. I want to make sure the cost story and the growth story are telling the same number."
