Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Of course. Let me grab my laptop—give me thirty seconds." She was already saving and closing the Q4 file, her mind shifting gears with practiced efficiency, even as a quiet pulse of adrenaline confirmed what she'd suspected since she saw him through the conference room glass: whatever came out of last night's board meeting was serious enough that Marcus needed someone he trusted to do the math before anyone else saw it.

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Thanks. Pull up the operating model—start with Rule of 40 bridge: growth, gross margin, opex. I need the cleanest story we can tell in one slide, and then the levers behind it. Engineering cloud spend and CS capacity first; those are the two that can blow up the narrative fastest. We’ve got Friday with Patricia and I’m not walking in with vibes."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Let’s focus on cloud spend and Customer Success first. I want a waterfall chart that breaks down the incremental impact for each lever—hosting optimization, headcount increases, price actions, anything that directly moves margin or retention. We’ll need sensitivity analysis for every assumption, and if there’s any shortfall, we need options. Sarah, I want you looped in—pull last quarter’s AWS audit and compare to the growth projections. Riley, track churn trends, and flag the top three drivers. We need to walk into Friday with facts, not just targets."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Understood. I'll pull the churn data segmented by cohort, contract size, and industry vertical so we can isolate what's actually driving the NRR decline versus what just looks noisy. I want to separate the mid-market logo churn from enterprise contraction revenue—those are two different problems with two different fix costs. On the cloud side, I'll cross-reference Sarah's AWS audit against revenue per customer to see if the hosting growth is volume-driven or inefficiency-driven, because that changes the margin story completely. One question before I dive in—when you say 'options' for the shortfall, David, how aggressive are we willing to get? Are we modeling scenarios that include headcount actions in engineering, or are we keeping this to operational efficiency and pricing levers only? I'd rather know the boundaries now than build something we have to rebuild Thursday night."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Model it all. Three scenarios: efficiency-only, efficiency plus pricing, and ‘full-contact’—including headcount actions in Engineering and anywhere else that’s materially off-plan. I don’t want to debate morality Thursday night; I want to show Patricia and the board the tradeoffs, the timing, and the blast radius. Put clear guardrails on each lever—savings, one-time costs, risk to roadmap, risk to NRR—and tag an owner. If we’re short, we’re not hand-waving it away."
