Step 2 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Marcus, give me two minutes—I need to pull the Q4 actuals against their pipeline conversion rates before we walk in there. If Sales is going to lowball Q1 again, I want the data on the table before they even finish their pitch. And remind me after—I need to block time this afternoon to start building the framework for the offsite deck."

Step 3 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "Riley's already positioning herself as Marcus's data gatekeeper—smart move, but premature. She doesn't realize the offsite deck is going to require framework decisions that live above her pay grade, decisions about which departments can absorb cuts without breaking revenue growth. I need to make sure Marcus understands that distinction before she turns tactical execution into strategic influence."

Step 4 office rules --- Event: David Chen -- "Karen, before Marcus commits to any framework decisions for the offsite, I want clear numbers from Riley on which teams can actually absorb cuts without threatening our revenue base. The board isn’t going to accept tactical moves dressed up as strategy, and neither am I. Let’s schedule time tomorrow to review the deck—I'll need your perspective on operational risk before we take this upstairs."

Step 5 office rules --- Event: Priya Sharma -- "David, loop me in on that review—before we let Riley’s cuts-by-line-item drive the story. If the offsite deck is going to land with the board, it needs a framework tied to Rule of 40: what we cut, what it does to EBITDA, and what it risks on revenue and NRR. Engineering is 55% of opex, but we’re not treating roadmap delivery and cloud efficiency as separate knobs. Give me 24 hours and I’ll bring you three scenarios: (1) AWS optimization with timelines and savings, (2) targeted headcount reallocation without slipping commitments, and (3) the ‘cut deeper’ option with explicit revenue impact. Then Marcus can make a strategic call with eyes open."

Step 6 office rules --- Event: Marcus Webb -- "Riley, pull it—but don’t turn this into a data custody play. I want the Q4 actuals vs pipeline conversion and the assumptions written in plain English so Sales can’t argue the math. After the meeting, you and I block 30 to align on what’s analysis versus what’s decision framework for the offsite deck."

Step 7 office rules --- Event: Riley Nakamura -- "Understood, Marcus. I'll have the Q4 actuals versus pipeline conversion laid out with assumptions in plain language—no ambiguity, no room for Sales to relitigate the inputs. And I appreciate the distinction on the offsite deck. I'll come to our thirty-minute block with a clean separation: here's what the data says, here's where the data ends and judgment begins. I'm not trying to make the calls—I'm trying to make sure whoever makes them can't claim they didn't see the trade-offs. One thing I do want to flag: Priya's putting together engineering scenarios, and I'd rather we're working from one integrated model than two competing spreadsheets. I'll reach out to her today so the numbers reconcile before anything hits your desk. If David wants a review tomorrow, I can have my portion ready by end of day."

Step 8 office rules --- Event: Karen Aldridge -- "David, I just saw Riley's message to Marcus about coordinating with Priya on an 'integrated model.' That's exactly the right instinct, but it needs someone who understands how Engineering's cost structure maps to revenue risk—not two analysts reconciling spreadsheets in a vacuum. Let me facilitate that conversation today and bring you a synthesis tomorrow that shows what the numbers actually mean for our customer commitments and competitive positioning. Riley's thorough with data, Priya knows Engineering's constraints, but neither of them has worked through a margin expansion this aggressive without breaking something critical. I have—twice. This review tomorrow needs to be about strategic trade-offs, not just scenario planning, and I want to make sure that's what lands on Marcus's desk before the offsite."
